**reprexlite** is tool for rendering **repr**oducible **ex**amples of Python code for sharing. It will execute your code and embed the outputs as comments below their associated lines. The rendered reprex can then be easily copied, pasted, and run as-is by anybody else. It is a lightweight alternative to [reprexpy](https://github.com/crew102/reprexpy) and is similarly meant as a port of the R package [reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex).

#### Why reproducible examples?

If you're asking for help or reporting a bug, you are more likely to succeed in getting others to help you if you include a good reprex.

#### Why reprexlite?

reprexlite helps you create a self-contained reprex that can be easily copy-pasted and run. Your code runs in an isolated namespace. The reprex is formatted so that it is valid Python code with outputs as comments, unlike copying from a REPL. reprexlite is also very lightweight and has a convenient CLI, so you can easily and quickly get it up and running in a virtual environment.

## Installation

reprexlite is available on PyPI:

```bash
pip install reprexlite
```

### Development version

The development version of reprexlite is available on GitHub:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/jayqi/reprexlite.git#egg=reprexlite
```

## Quick usage

### Command-line interface

The reprexlite CLI allows you to create a reprex without entering Python. Simply invoke the command

```bash
reprex
```

This will take you into your system's default command-line text editor where you can type or paste your Python code. On macOS for example, this will be `vi`. You can set your default editor using the `$EDITOR` environment variableâ€”I'm personally a fan of `nano`.

Once you're done, reprexlite will print out your reprex to console.

### Python library

```python
from reprexlite import reprex

code = """
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[x + 1 for x in arr]
"""

print(reprex(code))
```

## Comparison to reprexpy

Compared to reprexpy, reprexlite adds:

- A command-line interface so you can create reprexes without entering Python
- Lighter dependencies (e.g., no dependence on IPython)

However, reprexlite does not have:

- Direct ability to read from or write to your OS clipboard.
  - Instead, the CLI opens your default text editor which you can paste into.
- Automatic upload of matplotlib plots to imgur.com.
