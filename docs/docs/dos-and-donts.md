# Reprex Do's and Don'ts

This article discusses how to write an effective reprex. If you're asking for help or sharing code from someone, you will be much more likely to succeed if you have a good reprex. If you still need to be convinced why you should write a reprex or use reprexlite, check out the ["Design Philosophy"](../design-philosophy/)

The key ideas echo R reprex's ["Reprex do's and don'ts"](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html) and StackOverflow's ["How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example"](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
